# Summary

MaiBaam is manually annotated with part-of-speech tag, syntactic dependencies, and German lemmas.
The treebank encompasses diverse text genres (wiki articles and discussions, grammar examples, fiction, and commands for virtual assistants) and dialects from the North, Central and South Bavarian areas as well as the dialectal transition areas in between.

# Introduction

Although Bavarian is closely related to Standard German, there are morphosyntactic differences, several of which are reflected in the UD annotations. We detail these differences in the documents linked below. As there is no standard orthography for Bavarian, the spelling reflects the phonetic variation between different Bavarian dialects, as well as idiosyncratic spelling-related differences.

We include sentence-level metadata:
- `genre`: One of *wiki* (Wikipedia articles), *social* (Wikipedia discussion pages), *fiction* (fairy tales), *grammar examples* (Tatoeba sentences, example sentences from Wikipedia pages about Bavarian grammar), *non-fiction* (queries for virtual assistants).
- `dialect_group`: One of *north, northcentral, central, southcentral, south* if we know the dialect group (where, e.g., *southcentral* is the transition area between the South Bavarian and Central Bavarian dialect regions), *unk* (unknown) if we do not have any information on the dialect group, and a code like *unk (southcentral/south)* if we can narrow down the options to, in this case, South Bavarian or the South/Central transition area.
- `location`: The city or municipality if known, else the state or province, else the country, else *unk* (unknown). 
- `source`: For sentences from Wikipedia or Tatoeba, we include the source URL.
- `author`: The username of a Tatoeba sentence’s author, per [Tatoeba's usage conditions](https://tatoeba.org/en/terms_of_use#section-6).
- `text_en`: The original English sentence, for sentences translated from English (xsid, cairo).

The `sent_id`s indicate what source a sentence was taken from (see below).

The `MISC` column contains manually annotated German-language lemmas (`GermanLemma=...`) and, where appropriate, `SpaceAfter=No`.
